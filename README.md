# Bunco
Bunco is a multiplayer luck-based dice game. 
- 2 to 10 player game 
- Played with 3 dice with 6-26 sides each
- Number of rounds = Number of sides on dice
The objective of the game is to finish with the most number of points at the end of the rounds. 

Every round has a number called the target value 
- Round # corresponds with target value
- If the target is rolled once or twice 1 or 2 points are added to the player’s score
- If all numbers rolled are the same, a “Bunco” has been rolled
Buncos are very rare and greatly benefit the player.
